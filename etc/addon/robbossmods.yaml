            Phases: 1.\nSPELL(90250): Boss targets a player and charges
            after 2 seconds.  Strafe away or you'll be hit (or one-shot in
            hc)\nSPELL(90249): Frontal cone like a warrior's shockwave.\n
            SPELL(91937): Bleed on the tank which is cleared by healing past
            90%\nAdds: Four troggs will spawn.  CC or kill the malignant
            trogg (bigger and purple) away from the boss, or he'll debuff
            the tank with SPELL(90179) and buff the boss with SPELL(90169)

        strategy: >
            Phases: 1.\nCasts SPELL(93857) at intervals - kill the

    Ammunae:
        id: 39731
        strategy: >
            Phases: 1.\nOne or two DPS need to be assigned to kill
            the Seedling Pods that spawn.  They buff the boss, heal him and
            if not killed quickly become Bloodpetal Blossoms that cast
            SPELL(90007), an undispellable bleed.  Back on the boss when
            there are no pods up.
    Siamat:
        id: 44819
        strategy: >
            Phases: 2.\nIn phase 1, the boss is immune - kill adds: minions
            before servants.  In phase 2, the boss is tankable - keep
            killing servants (minions will disperse over time), but stay out
            of the green and white ground effects.
