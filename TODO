- add recursive metaicon support (keep drilling down if the member is a meta)

filter
------

- allow for filters with multiple sections
- allow for a section to have a 'final' flag, which means that if we get an
  exclude match we stop checking
- create 'match_with_value' to use the same filter logic with cork
- convert other modules to use WoWUI::Filter and WoWUI::FilterGroups:
  Hydra
  ChocolateBar
  CombatLogTrigger
  BrokerCurrency
  Bagnon
  Kong
  Raven
  DualBoxMacro
  Clique
  Cork
  Base
  FreeRefills
  Addons
  Digits
