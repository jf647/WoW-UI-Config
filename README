WoW-UI-Config
-------------

Configuration Files
-------------------

* etc/ui_config.yaml

The main configuration that drives everything else

* etc/addon/$ADDON.yaml

Per-addon configurations, where $ADDON is the 'slug' of the addon - tmw,
clt, dbm, etc.

* private/profiles.yaml

Your profile configuration, which lists the machines you build
configurations for and the players who use each of those machines

* private/machine/$MACHINE.yaml

Details about each machine you build a configuration for

* private/player/$PLAYER.yaml

Details about the characters and options of each player that you build a
configuration for

* private/ui_config.yaml

Overridden configuration if you don't like my defaults.  If present, this
is read and merged on top of etc/ui_config.yaml

* private/addon/$ADDON.yaml

Overridden addon configuration if you don't like my defaults.  If present,
these are read and merged on top of the like-named file in etc/addon.

Generic Configuration
---------------------

Private Configuration
---------------------

To separate the generic configuration (this addon is enabled for Protection
Warriors) from the private configuration (I have a Protection Warrior named
Tanky on Aggramar), you need to create at least two files in a subdirectory
named private.

You can either create a 'private' directory and populate it yourself, or you
can create your own git repository so that your own configs are tracked.  In
my personal development environment, I have my git repositories in /srv/git. 
I create an empty repository like this:

git init --bare /srv/git/WoW-UI-Config-Private.git

and then from the root of the WoW-UI-Config checkout, I run this command:

git clone /srv/git/WoW-UI-Config-Private.git private

If you're just starting out, you will want to create private/profiles.yaml
by copying the example file from the etc directory.  Then you need at least
one machine file in private/machine and at least one player file in
private/player.  Examples of each of these files are in the etc/sample
directory.

The reason for all this indirection is that it allows you to create
different configs using the same character data.  For example, I have two
gaming machines - one powerful and one a bit older, plus a netbook and a
laptop from work.  I might play any of my characters on any of these
machines, but I want to treat them differently in terms of what addons are
enabled.  The netbook has very little in the way of addons, but my main
machine has everything under the sun turned on.
